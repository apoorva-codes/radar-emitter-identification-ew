# Radar Emitter Identification, Localization & Jamming Recommendation for Electronic Warfare

## Overview

This project implements an end-to-end radar signal analysis pipeline for emitter identification, localization, and jamming recommendation using machine learning and signal processing techniques. The system simulates radar pulse environments, processes Pulse Descriptor Word (PDW) data, performs clustering-based emitter identification, estimates radar parameters, and provides decision support for electronic warfare scenarios.

The objective is to demonstrate how intelligent signal processing and machine learning can support automated threat analysis in complex and noisy environments.

## System Architecture

The overall processing pipeline follows these stages:

Radar Signal Generator → PDW Data Extraction → Data Preprocessing → Feature Normalization → Emitter Clustering → PRI Analysis → Radar Localization → Jamming Recommendation

(Architecture diagram will be added here)
